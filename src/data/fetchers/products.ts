  // Because the API is responding with duplicated items, for example the item XMI-RN13P5G,
  // we filter the response to remove them.
  //
  // In this way we avoid the next error from Next.js when we render the items grid:
  //
  // Encountered two children with the same key, `XMI-RN13P5G`.
  // Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.
  // Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
  //
  // Of course, this is a little hack for this challenge to avoid the bug in the API, the real solution should be to fix the API.
